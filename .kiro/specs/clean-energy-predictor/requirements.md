# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Clean Energy Predictor is a web application that helps users identify the cleanest hours of the day for electricity usage by analyzing real-time environmental and grid data. The application provides hourly predictions for the next 24 hours, visualizes cleanliness scores through an intuitive dashboard, and quantifies environmental impact in relatable terms. This empowers users to make informed decisions about when to use electricity to minimize their carbon footprint.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an environmentally conscious consumer, I want to see predicted cleanliness scores for each hour in the next 24 hours, so that I can schedule my high-energy activities during the cleanest periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the predictions endpoint THEN the system SHALL return hourly cleanliness scores for the next 24 hours
2. WHEN displaying predictions THEN the system SHALL show scores on a scale from 0-100 where 100 represents the cleanest energy
3. WHEN predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL update them automatically every hour with fresh data
4. IF real-time data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use the most recent available data and indicate the data age to users

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to visualize the cleanliness data through an intuitive color-coded timeline, so that I can quickly identify the best and worst times for energy consumption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a 24-hour timeline with color coding where green represents cleanest hours and red represents dirtiest hours
2. WHEN hovering over timeline segments THEN the system SHALL show detailed cleanliness scores and timestamps
3. WHEN the timeline updates THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition colors to reflect new predictions
4. WHEN displaying on mobile devices THEN the timeline SHALL remain fully functional and readable

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand the environmental impact of my energy choices in relatable terms, so that I can appreciate the real-world significance of using clean energy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the impact endpoint THEN the system SHALL return CO₂ savings equivalent in trees planted and kilometers of car emissions avoided
2. WHEN displaying impact metrics THEN the system SHALL show comparisons for using energy during cleanest vs dirtiest hours
3. WHEN calculating impact THEN the system SHALL use standard conversion factors (1 kWh clean energy = X kg CO₂ saved)
4. WHEN impact data is displayed THEN the system SHALL update metrics in real-time as predictions change

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user in different geographic locations, I want to select my specific location, so that I receive accurate predictions relevant to my local electricity grid.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the location selector THEN the system SHALL support major metropolitan areas and regions
2. WHEN a location is selected THEN the system SHALL fetch grid data specific to that region's electricity mix
3. WHEN location data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL notify users and suggest alternative nearby locations
4. WHEN switching locations THEN the system SHALL update all predictions and visualizations within 5 seconds

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive notifications when clean energy windows are approaching, so that I don't miss opportunities to reduce my carbon footprint.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a clean energy period (score >80) is predicted within the next 2 hours THEN the system SHALL send a notification
2. WHEN users enable notifications THEN the system SHALL respect their preferred notification methods and timing
3. WHEN notification preferences are set THEN the system SHALL allow users to customize thresholds and advance notice timing
4. IF users disable notifications THEN the system SHALL stop sending alerts but maintain prediction functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to automatically ingest real-time environmental and grid data, so that predictions remain accurate and current.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the data ingestion service runs THEN the system SHALL fetch environmental data from reliable APIs every 15 minutes
2. WHEN grid cleanliness data is available THEN the system SHALL integrate it with environmental data for comprehensive predictions
3. WHEN data ingestion fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and retry with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts
4. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 7 days of historical data for model training and validation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the AI prediction model to continuously learn and improve, so that prediction accuracy increases over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new data is available THEN the system SHALL retrain the prediction model daily using the latest 7 days of data
2. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL use regression or time-series forecasting algorithms appropriate for the data patterns
3. WHEN model performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and fall back to simpler prediction methods
4. WHEN evaluating model accuracy THEN the system SHALL track prediction error rates and maintain >75% accuracy for next-hour predictions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API endpoints, so that third-party applications can integrate with the clean energy prediction service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing /predictions endpoint THEN the system SHALL return JSON with hourly predictions, timestamps, and confidence scores
2. WHEN accessing /impact endpoint THEN the system SHALL return CO₂ savings data in multiple relatable formats
3. WHEN API requests include location parameters THEN the system SHALL return location-specific data
4. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and retry-after headers

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the application to work seamlessly on desktop and mobile, so that I can check clean energy predictions wherever I am.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a fully responsive interface optimized for touch interaction
2. WHEN using the application on desktop THEN the system SHALL utilize available screen space for enhanced data visualization
3. WHEN switching between devices THEN the system SHALL maintain user preferences and location settings
4. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL achieve a performance score >90 on Google PageSpeed Insights

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing coverage, so that the application maintains reliability and accuracy across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN the system SHALL achieve >90% code coverage for data ingestion, prediction, and API components
2. WHEN executing integration tests THEN the system SHALL validate end-to-end data flow from ingestion through prediction to API response
3. WHEN testing prediction accuracy THEN the system SHALL validate model performance against historical data with documented error rates
4. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL pass all automated tests before deployment to production
